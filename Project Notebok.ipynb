    "The project idea is inspired by the statistical model of standard distribution in galton board game. Ideally, we use an infinite number of sands to let them fall into a pile that has standard distributed shape. But to see how probability works, we use balls that fall through triangular shaped \"pegs\" so that each move is a 50/50 probability of going left or right. If numbers of rows and balls are relatively large, we can observe pattern of standard distribution by repeating the game. "
